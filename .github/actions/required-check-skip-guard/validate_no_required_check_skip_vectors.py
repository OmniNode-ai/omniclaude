# Required-Check Skip-Vector Guard (OMN-14854) — PR-time validator.
#
# Fails closed on any of the four skip vectors enumerated in the design spec
# (docs/design or ticket OMN-14854; grounded against
# `gh api repos/OmniNode-ai/omniclaude/branches/dev/protection/required_status_checks`,
# 58 contexts, fetched 2026-07-20):
#
#   1. A path-scoped `pull_request` / `pull_request_target` / `merge_group`
#      trigger on the workflow producing (or calling) a REQUIRED context —
#      a PR touching only excluded paths never runs the job, wedging the
#      required check PENDING forever.
#   2. A job-level `if:` on the job that IS the required context (Shape A)
#      that is not provably true for every PR-reachable event — a skipped
#      job counts as "passing" under GitHub branch protection, so this is a
#      silent bypass, not merely a wedge.
#   3. A caller job (`uses:` job) gated by a conditional `if:` that is not
#      provably true — when it evaluates false the reusable workflow never
#      runs, so the composed context is never even created (permanent
#      PENDING, worse than vector 2).
#   4. A required context's producing/caller workflow has no
#      pull_request/pull_request_target/merge_group trigger at all.
#
# Runs identically under pre-commit (local) and CI (the reusable workflow) —
# same script, same manifest, same verdict. Enforcement, not detection
# (CLAUDE.md Rule #5).
#
# Usage:
#   python validate_no_required_check_skip_vectors.py \
#       --manifest .github/required-checks.yaml \
#       --workflows-dir .github/workflows
