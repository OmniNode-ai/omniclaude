# Learned Patterns Repository Contract
#
# Defines database operations for pattern injection via contract-driven access.
# This contract is consumed by PostgresRepositoryRuntime from omnibase_infra.
#
# Part of OMN-1779: Wire ManifestInjector to contract runtime
#
# Default Values:
# - success_rate default: 0.5 (50%) - Used when no injection history exists.
#   Represents a neutral prior that doesn't bias toward or against new patterns.
#   This Bayesian prior allows new patterns to be tried without unfair penalty.

  Repository contract for learned patterns used in context injection.
  Patterns are stored in the learned_patterns table and injected into
  Claude Code sessions to improve response quality.
