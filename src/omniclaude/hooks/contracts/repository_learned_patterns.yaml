# Learned Patterns Repository Contract
#
# Defines database operations for pattern injection via contract-driven access.
# This contract is consumed by PostgresRepositoryRuntime from omnibase_infra.

# Part of OMN-1779: Wire ManifestInjector to contract runtime

  Repository contract for learned patterns used in context injection.
  Patterns are stored in the learned_patterns table and injected into
  Claude Code sessions to improve response quality.

# Tables this contract is allowed to access (enforced by validators)

  - learned_patterns

# Pydantic models for row mapping
# Format: alias -> module:class
models:
  PatternRow: omniclaude.hooks.handler_context_injection:PatternRecord

      Retrieve patterns that are validated, enabled, and current.
      Results are ordered by quality_score descending then pattern_id
