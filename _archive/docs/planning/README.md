## Document Organization

### Purpose of Each Category

**Project Status**: Track overall project completeness, integration dependencies, and strategic priorities. Essential for project management and resource allocation.

**Hook Intelligence**: Comprehensive documentation for the Hook Intelligence system, covering architecture, implementation, and impact analysis. Critical for understanding automated workflow intelligence capabilities.

## Navigation Tips

1. **Start here**: If you're new to the project, begin with the executive summaries:
   - [Hook Intelligence Executive Summary](./HOOK_INTELLIGENCE_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md) for strategic overview
   - [Integration Status](./INTEGRATION_STATUS.md) for current system state

2. **For developers**: Focus on implementation guides and architecture documents:
   - [Hook Intelligence Architecture](./HOOK_INTELLIGENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md)
   - [Hook Intelligence Implementation Guide](./HOOK_INTELLIGENCE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)

3. **For project management**: Use status documents for planning and tracking:
   - [Incomplete Features](./INCOMPLETE_FEATURES.md)
   - [Integration Status](./INTEGRATION_STATUS.md)

4. **For performance analysis**: Review velocity and optimization documents:
   - [Hook Intelligence Velocity Analysis](./HOOK_INTELLIGENCE_VELOCITY_ANALYSIS.md)

## Related Documentation

- **Architecture Documentation**: See `../archive/` for historical design documents
- **Security Documentation**: See `../security/` for security-related planning
- **Implementation Guides**: See project root for specific feature implementations

## Maintenance

These planning documents are living documents that should be updated:
- **Weekly**: Integration status and incomplete features tracking
- **Monthly**: Velocity analysis and performance metrics
- **Quarterly**: Strategic priorities and architectural decisions
