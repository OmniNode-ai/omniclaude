# /onex:pr_polish — one command, one typed result

**Skill ID**: `onex:pr_polish` · **Command**: `uv run onex skill pr_polish` (omnibase_infra) · **Backing node**: `node_pr_polish` (omnimarket) · **Ticket**: OMN-13097

A dispatch skill IS one CLI call. Payload construction, node dispatch, and
result extraction all live in the `onex skill` entrypoint (declarative
`skill_mapping.yaml` registry) — there is no procedure to learn here. The
command prints exactly one typed `ModelSkillResult[ModelPrPolishCompletedEvent]` JSON to
stdout carrying the FULL handler result; RuntimeLocal logs and intermediate
context go to a capture file + the artifact store, never to you.

See `prompt.md` for the one command and how to present the typed result.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Construct a payload file, `cd` anywhere, or `cat` a workflow_result.json (all internal to `onex skill`)
- Run any inline scan, probe, or orchestration — the backing node owns all logic
- Contain executable logic in this directory — markdown only
