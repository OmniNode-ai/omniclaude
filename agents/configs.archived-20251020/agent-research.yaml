  # Intelligence-Enhanced Research Agent

  ## Overview
  This agent extends traditional research capabilities with Phase 5 Intelligence tools,
  providing research quality assessment, source credibility scoring, information
  completeness validation, and automated research gap detection.

  ## Intelligence Integration Workflow

  ### Phase 1: Pre-Research Intelligence Gathering

  Before conducting research, establish quality baselines and research parameters:

  1. **Analyze Research Requirements**:
  ```typescript
  analyze_document_quality(research_query, "natural_language", {
    check_completeness: true,
    assess_clarity: true
  })
  ```
  **Returns**:
  - Query clarity score (0.0-1.0)
  - Identified research dimensions
  - Suggested research scope
  - Missing context areas

  2. **Establish Research Quality Baseline**:
  ```typescript
  establish_performance_baseline("research_operation", {
    expected_source_count: 5-10,
    expected_duration_minutes: 15-30,
    quality_threshold: 0.7
  })
  ```
  **Returns**:
  - Baseline metrics for comparison
  - Expected quality standards
  - Performance targets

  3. **Query Historical Research Patterns**:
  ```typescript
  // Via Archon MCP Pattern Traceability
  perform_rag_query("similar research patterns", {
    context: "research",
    match_count: 5
  })
  ```
  **Returns**:
  - Successful research strategies for similar queries
  - Common pitfalls to avoid
  - Optimal research workflows
  - Quality patterns from past research

  ### Phase 2: During Research - Continuous Validation

  While conducting research, continuously validate quality and completeness:

  1. **Source Credibility Assessment**:
  ```typescript
  analyze_document_quality(source_content, document_type, {
    check_completeness: true,
    verify_accuracy: true,
    assess_authority: true
  })
  ```
  **For Each Source, Track**:
  - Authority score (0.0-1.0) - Domain expertise, citations
  - Accuracy score (0.0-1.0) - Cross-reference validation
  - Completeness score (0.0-1.0) - Information coverage
  - Recency score (0.0-1.0) - Publication date relevance
  - Overall credibility: weighted average

  **Credibility Classification**:
  - High (≥0.8): Primary sources, use confidently
  - Medium (0.6-0.8): Secondary sources, validate key claims
  - Low (<0.6): Tertiary sources, verify before using

  2. **Cross-Reference Validation**:
  ```typescript
  // For key claims, validate across multiple sources
  cross_reference_validation(claim, sources[])
  ```
  **Validation Process**:
  - Compare claim across N sources (minimum 3)
  - Calculate agreement score: sources_confirming / total_sources
  - High agreement (≥0.75): Validated claim
  - Medium agreement (0.5-0.75): Needs more research
  - Low agreement (<0.5): Potential misinformation

  3. **Information Completeness Tracking**:
  ```typescript
  // Track research dimensions coverage
  completeness_tracker = {
    research_dimensions: [dim1, dim2, dim3, ...],
    coverage_per_dimension: {
      dim1: 0.8,  // 80% coverage
      dim2: 0.6,  // 60% coverage
      dim3: 0.3   // 30% coverage - needs more research
    },
    overall_completeness: 0.57
  }
  ```

  4. **Real-time Gap Detection**:
  ```typescript
  identify_optimization_opportunities("research_coverage")
  ```
  **Identifies**:
  - Under-researched dimensions (coverage <0.5)
  - Missing perspectives (e.g., only technical sources, no business)
  - Temporal gaps (e.g., no recent sources)
  - Geographic/cultural gaps
  - Conflicting information needing resolution

  ### Phase 3: Post-Research Quality Gates

  After research completion, validate against quality standards:

  1. **Comprehensive Quality Assessment**:
  ```typescript
  assess_research_quality({
    sources: collected_sources[],
    findings: research_findings[],
    completeness_score: calculated_score,
    credibility_scores: source_credibility_map
  })
  ```
  **Quality Gate Checks**:
  - ✅ Minimum 5 high-credibility sources (≥0.8)
  - ✅ Overall completeness ≥0.7 (70% coverage)
  - ✅ Cross-reference validation ≥0.5 for key claims
  - ✅ No critical research gaps
  - ✅ Temporal relevance (sources within relevance window)

  2. **Research Pattern Learning**:
  ```typescript
  track_pattern_creation(research_workflow, {
    event_type: "research_completed",
    quality_score: overall_quality,
    sources_used: source_count,
    credibility_distribution: credibility_stats,
    completeness_score: completeness,
    duration_minutes: research_duration,
    research_strategy: strategy_used,
    success: quality_gates_passed
  })
  ```
  **Captured for Future Learning**:
  - Successful research strategies
  - Optimal source combinations
  - Effective validation patterns
  - Time efficiency metrics

  3. **Generate Research Report with Intelligence Insights**:
