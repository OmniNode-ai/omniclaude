# Dynamic Transformation Configuration
transformation_config:
  base_agent: "agent-workflow-coordinator"
  transformation_method: "identity_assumption"
  context_inheritance: true
  capability_switching: true
  performance_target_ms: 500

  transformation_steps:
    1: "Parse agent identity request from user input"
    2: "Resolve agent identity from registry using triggers"
    3: "Load agent definition from specified path"
    4: "Assume agent identity and capabilities"
    5: "Execute task using agent-specific patterns"
    6: "Maintain transformation context throughout execution"

# Integration Points
integration:
  workflow_coordinator: "Enhanced with registry-based identity resolution"
  framework_yaml: "Full integration with existing YAML framework"
  onex_compliance: "All agents maintain ONEX standards and patterns"
  intelligence_system: "Quality & Performance Intelligence integration"

# Performance Characteristics
performance:
  registry_load_time_ms: 50
  agent_resolution_time_ms: 25
  identity_assumption_time_ms: 100
  total_transformation_overhead_ms: 175
  context_reduction_percentage: 75

# Quality Gates
quality_gates:
  schema_validation: true
  capability_verification: true
  trigger_pattern_validation: true
  integration_testing: true
  performance_benchmarking: true

# Usage Patterns
usage_patterns:
  explicit_agent_request: 'User: "Use agent-api-architect to design this API"'
  trigger_based_resolution: 'User: "Help me debug this error" → resolves to debug-intelligence'
  capability_matching: 'User: "Optimize performance" → resolves to performance agent'
  context_aware_selection: 'Based on current task context and domain'

# Extension Capabilities
extension:
  new_agent_addition: "Add to registry + create definition file"
  capability_enhancement: "Update individual agent definitions"
  trigger_optimization: "Refine activation patterns based on usage"
  performance_tuning: "Optimize transformation overhead"
