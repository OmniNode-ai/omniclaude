The suggested file name `node_consul_adapter_effect.py` also follows ONEX standards. \n\n**Contract Usage:** The design emphasizes a strong contract (`ModelConsulAdapterContractEffect`) for input validation and explicit communication, aligning with ONEX's contract-based interaction principle. The `execute_effect` method signature explicitly uses this contract. \n\n**SOLID Principles Adherence:** \n- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** The node focuses solely on Consul interactions, avoiding mixed responsibilities.\n- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Designed to be extensible via new contract actions or strategies for Consul operations, without modifying existing core logic.\n- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** The `ModelConsulAdapterContractEffect` should be minimal, defining only what's necessary for Consul interactions.\n- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** The node is designed to depend on an abstract Consul client interface rather than concrete implementations, promoting loose coupling.",
