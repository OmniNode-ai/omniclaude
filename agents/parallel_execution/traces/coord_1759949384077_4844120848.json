                "onex_compliance_notes": "The `NodeConsulAdapterEffect` design demonstrates strong compliance with the ONEX Architectural Framework:\n\n*   **Node Type Usage:** Correctly implements the 'Effect' node pattern. Its primary responsibility is external I/O (interacting with Consul) and producing side effects (registering/deregistering services, fetching configuration), which aligns perfectly with the `Effect` node definition.\n*   **Naming Conventions:** Adheres to the `Node<Name>Effect` convention (e.g., `NodeConsulAdapterEffect`). If implemented as a file, it would follow `node_consul_adapter_effect.py`.\n*   **Contract Usage:** The design implicitly assumes a `ModelContractEffect` for its `execute_effect` method (or similar interface) that defines the input/output structure for Consul interactions. This ensures contract-based communication and loose coupling with other ONEX nodes.\n*   **SOLID Principles Adherence:**\n    *   **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** The node has one clear responsibility: adapting and managing interactions with Consul. It does not handle business logic or data transformation, which would be delegated to Compute nodes.\n    *   **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Designed to be open for extension (e.g., adding new Consul operations by extending its interface or implementation) but closed for modification (by injecting different Consul client implementations or configurations without altering the core adapter logic).\n    *   **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Any concrete implementation of `IConsulAdapterEffect` (the implied interface) would be substitutable without affecting the correctness of client nodes that depend on it.\n    *   **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** The proposed `IConsulAdapterEffect` interface would be cohesive, only containing methods relevant to Consul interactions, thus not forcing clients to depend on methods they don't use.\n    *   **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** The `NodeConsulAdapterEffect` depends on abstractions (e.g., an `IConsulClient` interface, its own `IConsulAdapterEffect` interface) rather than concrete Consul client implementations, promoting loose coupling and testability.",

The design emphasizes clear separation of concerns, contract-based interaction, and adherence to SOLID principles, leading to a highly maintainable and scalable solution. Its role is to encapsulate all direct interactions with the Consul API, acting as a robust gateway for other ONEX nodes requiring Consul services.",
          "onex_compliance_notes": "The `NodeConsulAdapterEffect` design demonstrates strong compliance with the ONEX Architectural Framework:\n\n*   **Node Type Usage:** Correctly implements the 'Effect' node pattern. Its primary responsibility is external I/O (interacting with Consul) and producing side effects (registering/deregistering services, fetching configuration), which aligns perfectly with the `Effect` node definition.\n*   **Naming Conventions:** Adheres to the `Node<Name>Effect` convention (e.g., `NodeConsulAdapterEffect`). If implemented as a file, it would follow `node_consul_adapter_effect.py`.\n*   **Contract Usage:** The design implicitly assumes a `ModelContractEffect` for its `execute_effect` method (or similar interface) that defines the input/output structure for Consul interactions. This ensures contract-based communication and loose coupling with other ONEX nodes.\n*   **SOLID Principles Adherence:**\n    *   **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** The node has one clear responsibility: adapting and managing interactions with Consul. It does not handle business logic or data transformation, which would be delegated to Compute nodes.\n    *   **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Designed to be open for extension (e.g., adding new Consul operations by extending its interface or implementation) but closed for modification (by injecting different Consul client implementations or configurations without altering the core adapter logic).\n    *   **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Any concrete implementation of `IConsulAdapterEffect` (the implied interface) would be substitutable without affecting the correctness of client nodes that depend on it.\n    *   **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** The proposed `IConsulAdapterEffect` interface would be cohesive, only containing methods relevant to Consul interactions, thus not forcing clients to depend on methods they don't use.\n    *   **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** The `NodeConsulAdapterEffect` depends on abstractions (e.g., an `IConsulClient` interface, its own `IConsulAdapterEffect` interface) rather than concrete Consul client implementations, promoting loose coupling and testability.",
