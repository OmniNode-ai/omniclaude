# MYPY TYPE CHECKING CONFIGURATION - OmniClaude
# =============================================================================
#
# OWNERSHIP & MAINTENANCE:
#   - Owner: Engineering team / code reviewers
#   - Review: Quarterly (or when adding new ignores)
#   - Last Review: 2026-01-22
#   - Next Review: 2026-04-22
#
# APPROVAL REQUIRED FOR CHANGES:
#   - Adding new module ignores: PR review explaining WHY
#   - Adding exclusion patterns: Must document reasoning
#   - Removing ignores: Encouraged (improves type safety)
#
# GOAL: Gradually reduce ignores as type coverage improves.

# EXCLUSION PATTERNS - SIMPLIFIED
# =============================================================================
# Focus on core library type safety first. These exclusions are organized by
# category with explicit justification for each group.
#
# CATEGORIES:
#   1. Test files - Lower priority than production code, many dynamic patterns
#   2. Templates - Code generation templates with placeholders (not valid Python)
#   3. Examples - Demo/example files not shipped in production
#   4. Legacy - Modules scheduled for deprecation or refactoring
#   5. Generated - Files created dynamically by agent system at runtime
#
# NOTE: skills/ directory is NOT excluded - it contains production code that
# should be type-checked. If skills need exclusion, add explicit pattern.
# =============================================================================

    # Lower priority than production code; enable incrementally as tests mature.

    | ^claude_hooks/modified_performance_test\.py$

    # --- CODE GENERATION TEMPLATES ---

    # code generation (e.g., compute_node_template.py). These are NOT valid
    # Python and cannot be type-checked.
    # Note: agents/parallel_execution/templates/ contains VALID Python
    # (template strings stored in .py files) - could be enabled in future.

# =============================================================================
# IGNORE STRATEGY FOR MISSING IMPORTS
# =============================================================================
#
# WHY IGNORES ARE NEEDED:
#   This project uses a polymorphic agent system with dynamic module loading.
#   Many modules are imported via bare imports (e.g., `import action_logger`)
#   after sys.path is modified at runtime. Mypy cannot resolve these statically.
#
# THREE CATEGORIES OF IGNORES:
#   1. EXTERNAL LIBRARIES - Third-party packages without py.typed markers
#   2. BARE IMPORT MODULES - Internal modules imported without package prefix
#   3. AGENT PLUGINS - Runtime-loaded agent definitions from ~/.claude/
#
# GRADUAL ENABLEMENT STRATEGY:
#   Phase 1 (Current): Ignore all problematic imports to unblock development
#   Phase 2 (Next):    Add .pyi stubs for critical internal modules
#   Phase 3 (Future):  Refactor bare imports to use package-qualified imports
#
# HOW TO REDUCE IGNORES:
#   - For external libs: Check if stubs exist (pip install types-<package>)
#   - For bare imports: Refactor to `from agents.lib import <module>`
#   - For plugins: Consider type stubs in ~/.claude/stubs/
#
# CURRENT IGNORE COUNT: 54 modules (target: reduce by 10% quarterly)
# Cleanup 2026-01-23: Removed 17 [REMOVED] modules with no active imports
# =============================================================================

# =============================================================================
# EXTERNAL LIBRARIES WITHOUT TYPE STUBS
# =============================================================================
# Third-party packages that don't ship with type annotations or py.typed
# markers. Check typeshed periodically for new stubs.
#
# To check for available stubs:
#   pip index versions types-<package> 2>/dev/null

# BARE IMPORT MODULES - Internal Code with Runtime sys.path Modification
# =============================================================================
# These modules are imported as bare imports (e.g., `import action_logger`
# instead of `from omniclaude.lib.core import action_logger`) by scripts and
# examples that modify sys.path at runtime.
#
# CURRENT STATE (2026-01-23):
#   - Many modules migrated from agents/lib/ to src/omniclaude/lib/
#   - Some modules removed entirely during codebase cleanup
#   - Scripts/examples still use bare imports for backward compatibility
#
# FIX: Refactor to use package-qualified imports. Then remove these ignores.
#
# CATEGORIES:

# QUARTERLY REVIEW CHECKLIST
# =============================================================================
# Run these commands during quarterly reviews to identify opportunities to
# reduce ignores and improve type coverage.
#
# 1. CHECK FOR NEW TYPE STUBS:
#    for pkg in aiokafka confluent-kafka qdrant-client anthropic asyncpg; do
#        pip index versions types-$pkg 2>/dev/null && echo "Stubs available: $pkg"
#    done
#
# 2. COUNT CURRENT IGNORES (track trend):
#    grep -c "^ignore_missing_imports = True" mypy.ini
#
# 3. FIND UNUSED IGNORES (packages no longer imported):
#    grep "\[mypy-" mypy.ini | sed 's/\[mypy-\(.*\)\]/\1/' | while read mod; do
#        grep -rq "import.*$mod" agents/ config/ claude_hooks/ || echo "Unused: $mod"
#    done
#
# 4. RUN STRICT CHECK (identify type improvement opportunities):
#    mypy --strict agents/ config/ claude_hooks/ 2>&1 | head -100
#
# METRICS:
#   - Target: Reduce ignore count by 10% per quarter
#   - Current count: 54 module ignores (as of 2026-01-23)
#     - External libraries: 25 (third-party without stubs, including libcst, archon_intelligence)
#     - Bare imports: 17 total
#         - 12 [MIGRATED] modules (exist in src/omniclaude/lib/, bare import still used)
#         - 1 [SKILLS-LIB] module (plugins/onex/skills/_shared/)
#         - 2 [HOOK-LIB] modules (plugins/onex/hooks/lib/)
#         - 2 schema modules (schemas, schemas.*)
#     - Agent plugins: 12 (runtime-loaded from ~/.claude/)
#
# CLEANUP HISTORY:
#   2026-01-23: Removed 17 [REMOVED] modules with no active imports (only _archive/ refs)
