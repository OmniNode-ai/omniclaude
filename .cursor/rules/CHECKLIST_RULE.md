title: "Checklist Rule v4 - Dependencies & Context Enhanced"
alias: ["checklist rule", "work ticket system", "agent-first tickets", "dependencies"]
status: "CANONICAL"
last_updated: "2025-01-04"
description: >
  Enhanced agent-first work ticket system with dependency tracking, blocker management,
  cross-references, and context preservation. Handles complex interconnected work streams
  where agents need to switch between checklists without losing context.

purpose:
  • Simple file-based ticket system with dependency awareness
  • Epic → Ticket hierarchy with cross-cutting relationships
  • Agent-first design with context preservation
  • Code proximity with cross-checklist navigation
  • Blocker identification and unblocking strategies
  • Progress tracking across dependent work streams

# === Directory Organization ===
ticket_organization:
  structure: "status_directories"  # Same at both levels

  node_level:
    location: "{node}/work_tickets/"
    subdirectories:
      - "active/"      # Currently being worked
      - "completed/"   # Finished work
      - "blocked/"     # Waiting on dependencies
      - "backlog/"     # Planned but not started

  global_level:
    location: "work_tickets/"
    subdirectories:
      - "active/"      # Currently being worked
      - "completed/"   # Finished work
      - "blocked/"     # Waiting on dependencies
      - "backlog/"     # Planned but not started
      - "epics/"       # Epic-level organization
      - "cross_cutting/" # NEW: Cross-epic dependencies and blockers

# === Enhanced Hierarchy ===
hierarchy:
  level_1: "Epic (strategic checklist .md file)"
  level_2: "Work Ticket (self-contained checklist .yaml file)"
  level_2_5: "NEW: Dependency Map (cross-cutting relationships)"
  # NO LEVEL 3/4 - Each ticket contains its own checklist

# === Naming ===
naming:
  epic_pattern: "{system}_{area}_checklist_{sequence:02d}_{scope}.md"

# === What We DON'T Have (Still Simple) ===
removed_features:
  - "Complex CLI with subcommands"
  - "Web dashboards and analytics"
  - "AI-powered suggestions"
  - "Visual dependency graphs"
  - "Resource allocation"
  - "Permission models"
  - "APIs (REST/GraphQL)"
  - "Webhooks"
  - "Audit trails"
  - "Sub-tickets (level 3/4)"
  - "Complex metadata beyond dependencies"

# === Benefits for Complex Work ===
benefits:
  context_preservation: "Never lose your place when switching between work streams"
  dependency_awareness: "Clear visibility into what blocks what"
  progress_tracking: "Understand completion across interconnected work"
  unblocking_strategies: "Clear paths to resolve chicken-egg problems"
  cross_epic_navigation: "Work spans multiple epics without losing relationships"
  workaround_documentation: "Accept temporary solutions with clear cleanup plans"
