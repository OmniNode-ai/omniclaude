# Documentation Rename Mapping Table

**Project**: OmniClaude
**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Task**: Standardize all .md files to UPPERCASE.md format

---

## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Files Analyzed** | 113 |
| **Files Renamed** | 0 |
| **Files Already Compliant** | 113 |
| **Compliance Rate** | 100% |

---

## Rename Operations

**Status**: ✅ **NO RENAMES REQUIRED**

All 113 markdown files already follow the UPPERCASE.md naming convention. No `git mv` operations were performed.

---

## Mapping Table

| Old Name | New Name | Directory | Status |
|----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| *(No renames required)* | *(All files compliant)* | *(N/A)* | ✅ |

---

## What Would Have Been Done

If files had required renaming, the mapping would have looked like:

### Example Rename Scenarios (Hypothetical)

| Old Name | New Name | Directory | Git Command |
|----------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| incomplete_features.md | INCOMPLETE_FEATURES.md | docs/planning/ | `git mv docs/planning/incomplete_features.md docs/planning/INCOMPLETE_FEATURES.md` |
| myDocument.md | MYDOCUMENT.md | docs/ | `git mv docs/myDocument.md docs/MYDOCUMENT.md` |
| read-me.md | READ-ME.md | . | `git mv read-me.md READ-ME.md` |

---

## Actual File Status

All 113 files are already compliant with UPPERCASE.md convention:

### Sample of Compliant Files (First 20)

| # | Filename | Directory | Status |

| 1 | CHECKLIST_RULE.md | .cursor/rules/ | ✅ Compliant |

| 3 | README.md | . | ✅ Compliant |
| 4 | SECURITY_KEY_ROTATION.md | . | ✅ Compliant |
| 5 | TEST_DOC.md | . | ✅ Compliant |
| 6 | AGENT-PARALLEL-DISPATCHER.md | agents/ | ✅ Compliant |
| 7 | USER_GUIDE.md | agents/ | ✅ Compliant |
| 8 | ARCHITECTURE.md | agents/ | ✅ Compliant |
| 9 | ROUTING_DECISION_LOGGING.md | agents/parallel_execution/ | ✅ Compliant |
| 10 | INTERACTIVE_MODE_README.md | agents/parallel_execution/ | ✅ Compliant |
| 11 | README_MIGRATION_004.md | agents/parallel_execution/migrations/ | ✅ Compliant |
| 12 | MIGRATION_004_ARCHITECTURE.md | agents/parallel_execution/migrations/ | ✅ Compliant |
| 13 | MIGRATION_004_QUICK_REFERENCE.md | agents/parallel_execution/migrations/ | ✅ Compliant |
| 14 | MIGRATION_005_QUICKSTART.md | agents/parallel_execution/migrations/ | ✅ Compliant |
| 15 | DUAL_PATHWAY_ARCHITECTURE.md | agents/parallel_execution/ | ✅ Compliant |
| 16 | PARALLEL_WORKFLOW_BREAKDOWN.md | agents/parallel_execution/ | ✅ Compliant |
| 17 | STATUS.md | agents/parallel_execution/ | ✅ Compliant |
| 18 | DATABASE_SCHEMA.md | agents/parallel_execution/docs/ | ✅ Compliant |
| 19 | CONTEXT_FILTERING_README.md | agents/parallel_execution/ | ✅ Compliant |
| 20 | QUICK_START.md | agents/parallel_execution/ | ✅ Compliant |

## Verification

### Commands Used

```bash
# Find all markdown files
find . -name "*.md" -type f | grep -v '/.git/' | grep -v '/node_modules/'

# Count total files
find . -name "*.md" -type f | grep -v '/.git/' | wc -l
# Result: 113

# Check for files with lowercase in basename
find . -name "*.md" -type f | grep -v '/.git/' | grep -E '/[^/]*[a-z][^/]*\.md$'
# Result: (empty - no matches)
```

### Pattern Matching

**Lowercase Detection Pattern**: `/[^/]*[a-z][^/]*\.md$`

This regex matches any .md file where the basename (filename without directory path) contains at least one lowercase letter.

**Result**: No files matched this pattern, confirming 100% compliance.

---

## Git History Preservation

Since no renames were performed, git history remains unmodified. All 113 files retain their complete commit history.

If renames had been required, we would have used:

```bash
git mv old_name.md NEW_NAME.md
```

This preserves git history by marking the operation as a rename rather than delete+add.

## Deliverables

✅ **Delivered**:
1. ✓ Complete analysis of all .md files (113 files)
2. ✓ Rename mapping table (empty - no renames needed)
3. ✓ File inventory with directory organization
4. ✓ Compliance verification report
5. ✓ Count of files renamed: **0**

---

## Conclusion

The OmniClaude project demonstrates **excellent documentation hygiene** with all 113 markdown files already following the UPPERCASE.md naming convention. No action was required.

**Final Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - All files compliant, zero renames performed
