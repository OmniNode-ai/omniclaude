"""OCC companion-merged gate (OMN-15214, ported to omniclaude per OMN-15221/OMN-15224) — a
strict ``CI Summary`` gate.

Why this exists
---------------
On 2026-07-26 an automated "OCC queue hygiene" pass closed five OPEN
onex_change_control evidence companions (#5012-#5016) whose product PRs had
already MERGED, destroying three evidence chains (OMN-15199 / OMN-15200 /
OMN-15203) with no successor — OMN-15200 was THIS repo's chain (omniclaude
#1948, companions OCC#5014/#5015). The sweep's trigger state is exactly
"OPEN companion + MERGED product PR".

This gate makes that state unreachable at the merge boundary for this repo:
a product PR's ``CI Summary`` (a required branch-protection context on
omniclaude ``dev`` and ``main``) cannot go green until the OCC evidence cited
by the PR's
``Evidence-Source:`` line is DURABLE — i.e. the cited companion PR is MERGED,
or the cited commit SHA is an ancestor of an onex_change_control durable
branch (dev/main). Because the product PR cannot merge before its companion
does, "merged product + open companion" can no longer arise via the merge
path, and a companion-closing sweep has nothing load-bearing to destroy.

Deliberately NOT a new required status check: this job is registered in
:data:`scripts.ci.ci_summary_gate.GATE_JOBS` (completeness anchor — the
umbrella WAITS for it) and :data:`scripts.ci.ci_summary_gate.STRICT_SUCCESS_JOBS`
(a skip/cancel conclusion fails closed) and enforced through the existing
fail-closed ``CI Summary`` umbrella poller. Adding a new top-level
required context that does not report on every PR shape wedges merges
indefinitely (see CLAUDE.md, deploy-gate section); the umbrella pattern has no
such failure mode because its check-run always instantiates.

Verdict model (mirrors ci_summary_gate exit codes)
--------------------------------------------------
* ``PASS`` (0)    — evidence is durable, or the gate does not apply
  (non-PR event; trusted dependency-bot author, mirroring occ-preflight's
  OMN-13762 exemption).
* ``PENDING`` (2) — evidence may still become durable without a new commit:
  Evidence-Source not yet PATCHed onto the body by occ-autobind, companion
  still OPEN (auto-merge in flight), or a transient API error. The runner
  entrypoint polls; at the deadline PENDING converts to FAIL (fail-closed).
* ``FAIL`` (1)    — evidence can never become durable in this state:
  companion CLOSED without merging (the incident state), cited SHA not an
  ancestor of an OCC durable branch (squash-only merges guarantee a
  feature-branch head SHA never becomes one — the OMN-15216 defect), or a
  malformed Evidence-Source value.

The companion-must-merge-first ordering is safe: onex_change_control PRs have
no reverse dependency on product-PR merge state (occ-preflight validates OCC's
own PRs from their in-tree diff), and repo-level auto-merge is enabled there.
The incident's canary lane proved the ordering live: companion OCC#5008 merged
40+ minutes before its product PR.

# ``EVIDENCE_SOURCE_RE`` is ``^...$`` MULTILINE, which anchors at column 0 —

# always names a companion that really did merge — for some OTHER product PR —
# the failure direction here is a **false PASS** on the gate whose entire job is
# to prove the cited evidence is durable. Stripping first makes such a PR read
