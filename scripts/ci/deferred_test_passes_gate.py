"""CI Summary's evaluation of deferred ``test_passes`` DoD items (OMN-18157).

A contract's ``test_passes`` item means "the PR's CI is green". The pinned
change-control runner judges it with ``gh pr checks`` and fails on any check
that is not SUCCESS, SKIPPED or NEUTRAL, so inside the Contract Compliance Check
job it fails on that job's own running check. ``defer_test_passes_driver.py``
records such items instead of judging them; this module judges them in the
``CI Summary`` job, after the CI Summary verdict itself is SUCCESS.

Same pass set as the pinned runner (SUCCESS, SKIPPED, NEUTRAL), with seven
differences, each because the in-job evaluation could not work or because
``gh pr checks`` is not how GitHub reads a head:

* It reads the exact head this run gates (``commits/{sha}/check-runs``), so a
  later push cannot change what it judges.
* It judges this repository's CI: the check-runs GitHub Actions posts. A
  check-run another App posts is that App's report, not CI (measured on
  omnibase_core#1745: the change-control App posted ``occ-autobind / outcome``
  red for "nothing to commit" on a PR whose evidence was already bound and
  merged; the evidence gates, which are Actions jobs, judge evidence). A row
  that names no App is judged. Commit statuses are not read: they are posted by
  integrations, not by Actions.
* Same-named check-runs resolve latest-wins by ``(started_at, id)``, the rule
  GitHub applies to a required context. ``gh pr checks`` keys by workflow as
  well, which keeps a superseded red from one caller of a reusable workflow
  alive beside the green that replaced it. Unlike ``ci_summary_gate``'s L4
  reading, a newer ``skipped`` row is NOT dropped in favour of an older
  non-skipped one: skipped is a pass here, so a rerun that skips a job replaces
  the cancelled row an earlier run left (measured on omnibase_core#1745).
* Every ``CI Summary`` row is excluded: CI Summary is the judge, and two runs
  on one head must not wait on each other.
* A still-running check is PENDING, polled until the deadline and then a
  failure; a cancellation or failure inside ``ci_summary_gate``'s measured
  replacement windows (OMN-18355, OMN-17864) is PENDING rather than final.
* A cancelled matrix placeholder is dropped once its matrix expanded on this
  head. When a run is cancelled before a matrix is evaluated, GitHub leaves one
  row whose name still carries the unexpanded ``${{ ... }}`` expression. No
  later row can carry that name, so latest-wins would keep the cancellation for
  ever (omnibase_core#1772: CI run 36155199260, cancelled by its concurrency
  group, left ``Tests (Split ${{ matrix.split }}/...)`` beside run 36155334716,
  which expanded and passed the same matrix). Such a row is superseded when any
  other row's name matches the placeholder with each expression standing for
  non-empty text; the expanded copies are then judged under their own names.
  With no expanded copy the placeholder stays the verdict, and a placeholder
  that failed rather than was cancelled is always judged.
* A cancellation that its own workflow superseded is not a verdict (OMN-17427).
  A ``cancelled`` row is PENDING while a newer run of the same workflow is
  still running on this head, and is superseded (reported, not judged) when a
  newer run of that workflow on this head has finished, or when GitHub
  cancelled the row's run for a newer run in its concurrency group (the run's
  cancelled job carries GitHub's own annotation ``Canceling since a higher
  priority waiting request for <group> exists``). Measured on
  omnibase_core#1795, #1794 and #1793 (CI runs 36328548514, 36306444633,
  36306138828): ``auto-merge.yml`` keys its concurrency group on the PR
  number, a ``check_suite`` run on ``dev`` resolved to the same group and
  cancelled the head's run (``Enable Auto-Merge``, ``Resolve PR (fanout
  guard)``), and the replacement ran on a different sha, so no row on this
  head ever replaced the cancellation and every CI Summary on the head
  failed until someone re-ran the Auto-Merge run by hand. A failure is never
  superseded this way, a row with no run URL is judged as before, and an
  unreadable annotation leaves the row judged.

* A check-run that started after the PR merged is not the PR's CI (OMN-20369).
  On a push the recorded PR's head is judged, and workflows the PR's closing
  triggers (the node redeploy trigger, the post-merge deploy verify
  jobs, the release auto-tag) post rows on that same head after the merge. The
  PR's own CI never had them and could never fail on them, yet each red one
  turned the dev push's CI Summary red with no code defect (omnibase_infra runs
  36778623912, 36893261474, 36911667005, 36974717257; omnibase_core run
  36668301225). When the PR's head is resolved from the record, rows that
  started after its ``merged_at`` are dropped BEFORE latest-wins and reported,
  never judged; post-merge deploy verification has its own gate (the lab-pass
  receipt). A row with no readable ``started_at`` is judged, and a pull_request
  run (``--head-sha`` given, nothing merged) judges exactly what it did before.

Exit codes: ``0`` success, ``1`` failure.

Ported verbatim from omnibase_core
scripts/ci/deferred_test_passes_gate.py at ad62c0b92 (OMN-20138, as
omnibase_infra did under OMN-20135), so omniclaude's Contract Compliance Check reads the same evidence and runs
the same item scope as omnibase_core's. Keep the two copies identical in
behaviour; a fix to one belongs in both.
